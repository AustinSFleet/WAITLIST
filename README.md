# WAITLIST APP

This app simulates the function of the currently running "noWait" app, it can be run locally, just be sure to install your npm packages beforehand!

It is currently deployed via heroku, check it out HERE: https://onereallynicerestaurant.herokuapp.com/

This was a team exercise and was created in about thirty minutes so excuse the lack of styling, but hey it works!

if you want to run it locally just be sure to run npm install and you should be good to go!
